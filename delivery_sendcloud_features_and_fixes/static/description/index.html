                    On occasions there are products that are configured as KITs,
                    but at the time of shipping they may be described as a single product that includes all the subcomponents that they form.
                    Using this module it will be possible to send the KIT product including the subproducts that make it up.
                    <li>Install Delivery SendCloud KIT Product Module</li>
                    <li>Go to Sendcloud --> Configuration --> Integration and select your active Sendcloud Integration</li>
                    <li>You will find a "KIT product" checkbox. If it is checked the new function will be used.</li>

                    <li>The <b>price</b> is modified, since in the case that the product is a KIT and the functionality of sending it as a single component is not activated, the price is not correctly taken.
                        What has been done is to indicate the proportional part within the KIT based on the price that this component has.</li>
                    <li>The <b>weight</b> is modified, as with the price, it is not taken correctly if the product is part of a KIT</li>
                    <li>Modify the shipping methods so that it takes into account only those that meet the weight of the order</li>
